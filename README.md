## an implementation of the quad tree contour plot algorithm in Java

For your own sanity: if you want to implement this yourself, don't do it in Java. This was 
a deliberate barrier, but if I had to do it again, I'd do it in Kotlin or Rust.

### TODO

- [X] explicit Graphs
- [X] implicit Graphs
  - [X] quadtree
  - [ ] partial derivatives
- [ ] Functions
  - [ ] trigonometry
  - [ ] sum
- [ ] Nice to haves
  - [ ] root estimation 

### dependencies:

- JRE
